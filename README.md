# General Computational Fluid Dynamics Solvers
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/davidt964/Fluid-Jupyter-Notebooks.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/davidt964/Fluid-Jupyter-Notebooks)

A set of in-progress Jupyter and MATLAB notebooks/programs written by David Tran that seek to ease computations of compressible flow and provide visualizations of potential flow and simple solutions to the 1D and 2D Euler equations along with Laplace's/Poisson's equation. Written in Python and/or MATLAB, the notebooks/scripts use computational packages to power the calculations and models. The potential flow notebook, in particular, generates streamlines for various flows such as uniform flow, source/sink, doublet, and combinations of the previous flows using the principle of superposition.

Other notebooks also explore various methods: the method of images and the source panel method. In particular, the source panel method is *powerful*, and this repository seeks to apply this method to various airfoils for means of analysis: for instance, calculating the lift ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?L) and drag ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?D) and visualizing the distribution of the pressure coefficient ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C_p) in the simulation space. Other scripts, for example, plot the density and pressure (along with other desired flow quantities such as Mach number) profile/contours depending on if the problem is 1D or 2D and compare with a known analytical solution for the problems of a 1D shock tube or 2D oblique shocks.
