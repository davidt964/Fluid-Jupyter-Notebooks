A set of in-progress Jupyter notebooks written by David Tran that seek to ease computations of compressible flow and provide visualizations of potential flow and simple solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Written in Python, the notebooks take advantage of computational packages to power the calculations and models. The potential flow notebook, in particular, generates streamlines for various flows such as uniform flow, source/sink, doublet, and combinations of the previous flows using the principle of superposition.
