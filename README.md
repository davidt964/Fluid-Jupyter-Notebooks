A set of in-progress Jupyter notebooks written by David Tran that seek to ease computations of compressible flow and provide visualizations of potential flow and simple solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations. Written in Python, the notebooks take advantage of computational packages to power the calculations and models. The potential flow notebook, in particular, generates streamlines for various flows such as uniform flow, source/sink, doublet, and combinations of the previous flows using the principle of superposition.

Other notebooks also explore various methods: the method of images and the source panel method. In particular, the source panel method is *powerful*, and this repository seeks to apply this method to various airfoils for means of analysis: for instance, calculating the lift $L$ and drag $D$ and visualizing the distribution of the pressure coefficient $C_p$.
