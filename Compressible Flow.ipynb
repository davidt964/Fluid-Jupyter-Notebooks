    "# General Overview\n",
    "Flow can be categorized into one of two categories: incompressible flow ($M \\leq 0.3$) and compressible flow ($M > 0.3)$. In aerodynamics, incompressible flow fails to provide accurate results due to the compressible effects of gases at speeds greater than Mach Number 0.3. Thus, it is useful to construct a set of tools that expedite compressible flow calculations, especially considering the often lengthy equations involved! This first set of functions simply calculates the speed of sound for a given gas at a given temerature $T$ and the Mach Number for that gas in a flow with velocity $u$. The local speed of sound $a$ for a given gas is given by\n",

Also, stagnation enthalpy $h_0 = h + \\frac{1}{2}u^2$ remains unchanged since shocks do not add or remove thermal energy.
