The MATLAB source panel method will be added after this Friday (4/23/2021), along with a report and its corresponding .tex file to demonstrate the results in comparison to 
published panel methods and experimental data (which can be found in the .dat files). In the meantime, I have various other MATLAB projects in other repositories for you
to check out!
